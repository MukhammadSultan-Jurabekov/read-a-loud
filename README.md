# Read-A-Loud

This project is a simple Python application that reads aloud the content of a text file using the `pyttsx3` library. It's particularly useful for developers who want to hear their code read aloud, which can be helpful for identifying issues or simply reviewing code in a different way.

## Features

- Text-to-speech conversion using the `pyttsx3` library.
- Customizable voice, speed, and volume settings.
- Reads any text file aloud, including code files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyttsx3` library

You can install the required library using pip:

```
pip3 install pyttsx3
```
Usage
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/read-a-loud.git
```
```
cd read-a-loud
```

Edit read-loud.py to specify the file you want to be read aloud. Replace 'your_code_file.py' with the path to your file.

Run the application:

```
python3 read-loud.py

```
The content of the file will be read aloud using your system's text-to-speech engine.

Customization
You can customize the voice, rate, and volume in the engine.py file:


rate: Controls the speed of the speech.
volume: Controls the volume of the speech.
voice: You can choose between different voices available on your system.
